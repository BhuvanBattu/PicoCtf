# Transposition-Trial

The challenge provides with cipher text:
heTfl g as iicpCTo{7F4NRP051N5_16_35P3X51N3_V9AAB1F8}7

As the challenge states that the words have been divided into groups of 3:

heT : The\
fl_ : _fl\
g_a : ag_\

We see that when we join the words after unscrambling, the sentence starts to make sense. Using a prgram in java we get the following output:
